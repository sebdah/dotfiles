# dotfiles

Awesome dotfiles for this and that! Most of them would work fine on both OS X
and Linux.

The repo is now using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for
configuration. Run `./install` to link all relevant things into your
environment.

## Update Brewfile

    brew bundle dump > Brewfile
